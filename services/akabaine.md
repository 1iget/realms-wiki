### Akaibane bot:

The Akaibane archiving PircBotX implementation is Bibanon's present, IRC bot as of writing this article, designed to aid in archival tasks.

Currently it is not for use by non-members and therefore won't respond to queries aside from .time

The source code is available on Github (planned.)

Planned features:

* .grab (grab site): archive a webpage with grab-site <igsets> <http://site/> 
* Internet Archive upload.
* Check to see if a grab-site job is already on internet archive.
* .is [site]: archive a webpage to archive.is. Returns url of archived page.
* .time (Planned to GMT)
* URL checking on channel (Echo URL page title)
* Auto Archive urls in IRC

Gaz's suggestions: 

* Allow for regex ignores to grab-site rather than just igsets.
* Stop grab-site job using .grab stop ID.
