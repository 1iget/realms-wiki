## Sidebar

Realms Wiki currently does not support a sidebar. Maybe that's for the best. But something needs to replace it.

### Home Page

The home page should have a set of tables containing basically the same data as on the sidebar (with most popular pages linked).

The tables should be inspired by the design of Mediawiki homepages, which use columns to make best use of screen space. 

Though somehow they need to be responsive to mobile layouts, and turn back into a list of tables rather than side by side.

### Navigation Bar

Maybe a configurable Navbar along the top with links to top-level sections would be a great alternative.

## Stagnant or Copied Data

There's a lot of stagnant or out of place data inherited from the Lurkmore and Insurgency Wikis on the Gollum wiki. 

Not everything should get imported, and some of it needs to be consolidated before being copied over.

## Fate of the Gollum Wiki

The Github Gollum Wiki should probably be frozen to new edits, but left the way it is, since we as archivists loath broken links, and it would probably destroy our SEO status on Google.

There should be a notice on the sidebar, header, or footer informing the user that the wiki has been moved to wiki.bibanon.org. 

Maybe the wiki should also be somewhat cleaned up for the last time.
