EternalArchive Acquisition
==========================

The Acquisition department of EternalArchive is responsible for actually obtaining the cultural content, drawing from the lists that the [Discovery](/etarc/discover) Department has made.

Once the content is obtained, it is pushed to the [Archival](/etarc/archive) Department for archival on LTO tape or the Internet Archive (if public domain).
