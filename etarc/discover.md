## Tools

We need tools to record what works we need to find in a list system. This list also needs to show what we've already "watched" (archived), are "watching" (downloading), and what we "want to watch" (need to grab in the future).

### American TV

need some sort of list system for American TV

IMDB has some good lists by year in box office or popular rating:

By box office for 2015 gross:

By popularity for 2015:

http://www.imdb.com/search/title?sort=moviemeter&title_type=feature&year=2015,2015

Depending on the amount of storage you may want to archive the top 10,25 or 50 movies and so on, grabbing the rest when you have more room.

### Hummingbird.me (Anime)

This is the best way to list the anime we've collected and are worth collecting.

## Chronologic Archival

One method of deciding what to archive is to do so systematically: that is, (in terms of seasons) newest to oldest.

The benefit of this method is that the freshest content is easier to retrieve, and things thin out around the oldest content anyway.

One drawback is that multiseason series might get separated into different seasons.

### Anime: Summer and Winter

Seasons for Japanese anime are Summer and Winter.

## Systematic Archival

Another method of deciding what to archive is to do so on the basis of the first airing. This has the benefit of matching all the seasons of a show together.
