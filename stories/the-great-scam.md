## Introduction

> While wandering the net one fine evening (actually on the shitter at work  while on my PDA) I discovered "The Great Scam" on [Something Awful](/places/something-awful). A story about achievements, greed, deception and a little game called Eve-Online. In other words, a great little story.
> 
> This story has nothing to do with me or anyone I know for that matter. It was just something I found, liked, and figured what the fuck might as well buy a cool domain and mirror it. So I did.
>
> Now, without further ado.. The Great Scam.
