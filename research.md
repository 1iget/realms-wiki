>the following is a todo of topics to research for the wiki

3:40 PM <•Akaibu> yo antonizoon i know i a list of actual 4chan related sites, but i'm about to make a related list of sites or project that have some 4chan origin, like katwa shoujo,volafile and yandere simulator

3:42 PM <•Akaibu> also, i was thinking about the whole internet culture thing we do, and the fact that we mainly only do fourms/chans, we should also do some research on many of the cult following inde games such as limbo,undertale, ect as they have just as major impacts on the internet culture as said fourms/chans
